Project Title: TiffinConnect: Bridging Sellers and Buyers in Multiple Regions

Problem Statement:
In bustling urban areas with diverse communities, there exists a challenge for individuals seeking homemade meals, especially students or workers, to find reliable tiffin services for their lunch and dinner needs. On the other hand, numerous home-based cooks or small-scale sellers prepare delicious meals but struggle to reach potential customers due to limited visibility.

Our project aims to address this gap by creating a digital platform called TiffinConnect. TiffinConnect will serve as a centralized marketplace where sellers and buyers can connect seamlessly, facilitating the exchange of homemade meals in multiple regions.

Key Features:

User Registration and Profiles: Buyers and sellers can create accounts, providing details such as location, cuisine preferences, and dietary restrictions.
Search and Filter Options: Buyers can search for tiffin services based on location, cuisine type, price range, and ratings.
Seller Listings: Sellers can create listings showcasing their menu offerings, pricing, delivery options, and customer reviews.
Ordering and Payment: Buyers can place orders directly through the platform and make secure payments.
Ratings and Reviews: Both buyers and sellers can rate and review each other, fostering trust and transparency within the community.
Messaging System: A built-in messaging system allows buyers and sellers to communicate regarding orders, special requests, and delivery details.
Notifications: Users receive notifications for order confirmations, delivery updates, and new listings in their area.
Project Objectives:

Provide a convenient and reliable platform for buyers to access homemade meals conveniently.
Empower sellers by expanding their customer reach and increasing visibility for their tiffin services.
Foster a sense of community and trust among users through transparent reviews and ratings.
Streamline the tiffin ordering process, making it seamless and hassle-free for both buyers and sellers.

By developing TiffinConnect, we aim to revolutionize the way homemade meals are accessed and delivered, creating a win-win situation for both buyers and sellers in multiple regions.
